# Go Random Password Generator

## About
A simple application to generate a random password from parameters outlined by the user. This project was created not only as a simple practice exercise, but to be used as a starting point for future Go CLI tools that utilize the [Survey](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/survey) library, a Golang tool inspired by the NodeJS ecosystem's [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme).


## Usage
```
  go run main.go
```
